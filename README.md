# Projects

∙ Developed a decentralized platform for secure and efficient supply chain management using Blockchain technology, resulting in reduced fraud and improved transparency. The platform was built using Ethereum and Solidity and integrated with existing supply chain management systems using APIs.

∙ Built and trained a machine learning model to predict stock prices with high accuracy, resulting in improved investment decisions for clients. The model was built using TensorFlow and trained on a large dataset of historical stock prices.

∙ Implemented a continuous deployment pipeline for a microservices-based web application using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS ECS, resulting in faster and more reliable releases. The pipeline included automated testing and deployment to multiple environments, such as staging and production.

∙ Improved the scalability and reliability of a cloud-based AI platform by deploying it on Kubernetes and automating the management of the cluster using Ansible. The deployment included setting up autoscaling and monitoring to ensure the platform could handle varying workloads and provide high availability.

# Education

∙ Associate's degree in Computer Science.

∙ Completed courses in Blockchain and AI at the University of Harvard.


I'm mostly a self-taught programmer with a passion for constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.
